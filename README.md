This is a build of the Zig compiler for AMD64 processors that belong to the "znver1" family.

It is Zig version 0.9.0, I bootstrapped it for compiling the River window manager on my personal machine.
It took quite a long time, so I figured I would keep it around and put it on Github in case someone else with
a processor in the "znver1" family would like to use it.

It was built with the Zig bootstrapper, on my Gentoo linux installation with GCC.

This repository will inherit the licensing of the Zig compiler master branch- which is the MIT license,
I have provided a copy of this license in the repository.
